# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A short checklist to make contributions smooth:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Run linters and tests locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run test
```

3. Keep commits focused and descriptive.
4. Open a PR against `main`/`master` with a clear summary and testing steps.

Optional:
- Use `DEVELOPMENT.md` for local setup.
